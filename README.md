# Comparative Analysis of Classification Models for Stroke Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely intervention and treatment.  
This project applies **machine learning classification models** to predict stroke outcomes based on health and lifestyle data.

## 🚀 Features
- Dataset sourced from **Kaggle**: [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)  
- **Data preprocessing**: removal of duplicates, null values, and outliers  
- **Feature selection** using correlation matrix and parallel coordinates  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with statistical summaries and visualizations  
- **Five classification algorithms implemented**:
  - Logistic Regression (LR)  
  - Decision Tree (DT)  
  - Naive Bayes (NB)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

## 📊 Results
Model performance (accuracy scores):  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – 96%  
- **Logistic Regression (LR)** – 96%  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – 95%  
- **Decision Tree (DT)** – 92%  
- **Naive Bayes (NB)** – 90%  

Additional metrics such as **precision, recall, and F1 score** were computed to evaluate performance.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
